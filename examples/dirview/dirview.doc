  \title A Directory Browser

  This example program demonstrates how to use a listview and
  listview items to build a multi-column hierarchical, memory- and
  CPU-efficient directory browser. It also demonstrates how to use
  Drag&Drop in a listview.

  Header file:

  \include dirview/dirview.h

  And here is the main implementation file.  Note the way the program
  scans subdirectories only when it has to.  This allows the program
  to handle very large file systems efficiently.  The same technique
  can be used in any other trees.

  \include dirview/dirview.cpp

  <hr>

  Main:

  \include dirview/main.cpp
