  \title Tic Tac Toe

  This is an implementation of the Tic-tac-toe game.

  We didn't put much effort in making a clever algorithm so it's not a
  challenge to play against the computer. Instead, study the source code
  to see how you can make reusable components such as the \e TicTacGameBoard
  widget.
