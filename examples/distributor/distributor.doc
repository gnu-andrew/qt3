    \title Qt Distribution Example

    This example program modifies the hard-coded paths that are
    compiled into the Qt library.

    When distributing the Qt library, the final installation prefix is
    very rarely the same as the prefix used when doing development.
    You can use the code from this example to modify the following
    hard-coded paths in Qt library:

    \list

    \i Prefix - Normally, all other paths are relative to the \e
    Prefix.

    \i Binaries - Location of binaries distributed with Qt (for
    example, \e{Qt Assistant}).

    \i Documentation - Location of the Qt documentation.

    \i Headers - Location of the Qt headers.

    \i Libraries - Location of addition libraries distributed with Qt
    (for example, the \e qui library).

    \i Plugins - Location of the Qt plugins.

    \i Data - Location of applicaton specific data for all programs
    distributed with Qt.

    \endlist
