  Biff is a simple graphical program to indicate whether there is new
  mail; it looks exactly like xbiff but is much shorter.

  Header file:

  \include biff/biff.h

  <hr>

  \e biff.cpp implements this custom widget.  Note in particular
  how two images (\e hasmail_bmp_data and \e nomail_bmp_data, both from
  \e bmp.cpp) are included into the executable.

  \include biff/biff.cpp

  Main:

  \include biff/main.cpp
