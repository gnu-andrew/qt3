  \title Connect the Points

  This example shows very simple mouse-based user interaction and
  painting without any world transform matrix or other advanced
  features.  Run the program, click the button, move the mouse,
  release the button, and watch the lines get drawn.

  Implementation:

  \include drawlines/connect.cpp
