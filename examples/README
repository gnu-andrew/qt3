This examples directory contains lots of Qt examples. And there are
additional examples in ../tools/designer/examples/ and in the
extensions subdirectories. The documentation contains two detailed Qt
tutorials and additional tutorials for Qt Designer. The examples here
are useful for learning particular Qt classes and techniques, but to
learn Qt itself we recommend starting with the documentation's short
"How to Learn Qt" document.

It is best to run each example from its own directory since some of
them assume they are run from there.
