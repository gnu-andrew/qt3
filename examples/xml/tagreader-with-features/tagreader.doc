  \title Demonstration of SAX2 features
 
  This example presents a small \link xml.html#sax2 SAX2 \endlink
  reader that outputs the qualified names and the
  respective namespace URIs of all elements and attributes in an
  XML file. Additionally the tree structure of the document is displayed.

  In three listviews the program shows the different output of the reader
  depending on how the SAX2 \link xml.html#sax2Namespaces features \endlink
  \e http://xml.org/sax/features/namespaces and
  \e http://xml.org/sax/features/namespace-prefixes are set.

  This example is thoroughly explained in a 
  \link xml-sax-features-walkthrough.html walkthrough. \endlink
