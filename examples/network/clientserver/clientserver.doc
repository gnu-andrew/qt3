  \title A small client-server example
 
  This example shows how two programs can communicate using sockets.

  Two simple example programs are provided, a client program and a
  server program. Both use the QSocket class, and the server also uses
  QServerSocket class.
  
  The server listens on port number 4242 and accepts incoming connections.
  It sends back every line it receives from the client, prepended with
  the line number.

  The client tries to connect to the server on the host specified on the
  command line or to localhost if no command line arguments are
  specified. You can send single lines to the server.
