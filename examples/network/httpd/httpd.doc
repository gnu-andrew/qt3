  \title A simple HTTP daemon
 
  This example shows how to use the QServerSocket class. It is a very
  simple implementation of a HTTP daemon that listens on port 8080 and
  sends back a simple HTML page back for every GET request it gets. After
  sending the page, it closes the connection.

  Implementation (httpd.cpp):
 
  \include network/httpd/httpd.cpp
