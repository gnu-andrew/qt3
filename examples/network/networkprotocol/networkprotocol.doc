  \title A simple NNTP implementation
 
  This example shows how to implement your own QNetworkProtocol. The
  protocol that was chosen for this example is NTTP. Please note that this
  implementation is very simple since it is designed to be an example. It
  should not be used as a real NNTP implemention.
