  \title A Complete Application Window with Actions

  The QAction class provides a way of associating user input from different
  user interface elements with abstract high level actions. This approach makes
  it easy to customize applications for different types of users.

  This example program is just like the
  <a href="simple-application-example.html">application example</a>,
  but uses QAction to build the menu and the toolbar.
