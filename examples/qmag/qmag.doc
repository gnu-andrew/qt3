  \title QMag

  This is a simple magnifier-type program.  It shows how one can do
  some quite low-level operations in a portable way using Qt.

  Run it, click in the magnifier window, then click where you want to
  magnify or drag out a rectangle.  Two combo boxes let you select
  amplification and refresh frequency, a text label tells you the color
  of the pixel the cursor is on, and a button lets you save the
  magnified area as a .bmp file.

  Implementation:

  \include qmag/qmag.cpp
