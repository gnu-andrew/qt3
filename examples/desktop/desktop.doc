  \title Painting on the Desktop

  The desktop demo contains three routines, each of which draws
  something on the desktop.  It does some nice stuff with QPainter,
  and also demonstrates how one can treat the desktop as a widget like
  any other.

  Implementation:

  \include desktop/desktop.cpp
