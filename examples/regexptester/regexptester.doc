    \title A Small Application for Testing Regular Expressions
    
    Regular expressions can sometimes be tricky to get right,
    especially those that use the * quantifier. This application lets
    you type in a regexp (without doubling the backslashes) and some
    test text, and to execute the regexp and see the results. If you
    click the Copy button the regexp will be copied to the clipboard
    (with the backslashes doubled, ready for you to paste into your
    program). Previous regexps and test texts are remembered
    throughout the session and can be accessed by dropping down the
    comboboxes.
