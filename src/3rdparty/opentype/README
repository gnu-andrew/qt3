This directory includes code for using OpenType Layout tables from
OpenType fonts with FreeType. It is taken from the Pango project who
ported it from Freetype-1.x to Freetype-2.

The table reading code in:

 ftxopen.[ch]
 ftxopenf.h
 ftxgdef.[ch]
 ftxgpos.[ch]
 ftxgdef.[ch]

The license for these files is in the file freetype-license.txt. 

disasm.[ch] is a partial dumper for OpenType layout tables useful
in figuring out what is going on.
