    \class QSocketDevice qsocketdevice.h
    \brief The QSocketDevice class provides a platform-independent low-level socket API.
\if defined(commercial)
    It is part of the <a href="commercialeditions.html">Qt Enterprise Edition</a>.
\endif

    \ingroup io
    \module network

    This class provides a low level API for working with sockets.  Users of
    this class are assumed to have networking experience. For most users the
    QSocket class provides a much easier and high level alternative, but
    certain things (like UDP) can't be done with QSocket and if you need a
    platform-independent API for those, QSocketDevice is the right choice.

    The essential purpose of the class is to provide a QIODevice that
    works on sockets, wrapped in a platform-independent API.

    When calling connect() or bind(), QSocketDevice detects the
    protocol family (IPv4, IPv6) automatically. Passing the protocol
    family to QSocketDevice's constructor or to setSocket() forces
    creation of a socket device of a specific protocol. If not set, the
    protocol will be detected at the first call to connect() or bind().

    \sa QSocket, QSocketNotifier, QHostAddress
*/


/*!
    \enum QSocketDevice::Protocol

    This enum type describes the protocol family of the socket. Possible values
    are:

    \value IPv4 The socket is an IPv4 socket.
    \value IPv6 The socket is an IPv6 socket.
    \value Unknown The protocol family of the socket is not known. This can
	   happen if you use QSocketDevice with an already existing socket; it
	   tries to determine the protocol family, but this can fail if the
	   protocol family is not known to QSocketDevice.

    \sa protocol() setSocket()
*/

/*!
    \enum QSocketDevice::Error

    This enum type describes the error states of QSocketDevice.

    \value NoError  No error has occurred.

    \value AlreadyBound  The device is already bound, according to bind().

    \value Inaccessible  The operating system or firewall prohibited
			the action.

    \value NoResources  The operating system ran out of a resource.

    \value InternalError  An internal error occurred in QSocketDevice.

    \value Impossible  An attempt was made to do something which makes
    no sense. For example:
    \code
    ::close( sd->socket() );
    sd->writeBlock( someData, 42 );
    \endcode
    The libc ::close() closes the socket, but QSocketDevice is not aware
    of this. So when you call writeBlock(), the impossible happens.

    \value NoFiles  The operating system will not let QSocketDevice open
    another file.

    \value ConnectionRefused  A connection attempt was rejected by the
    peer.

    \value NetworkFailure  There is a network failure.

    \value UnknownError  The operating system did something
    unexpected.
