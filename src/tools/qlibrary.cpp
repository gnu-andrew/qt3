    \class QLibrary qlibrary.h
    \reentrant
    \brief The QLibrary class provides a wrapper for handling shared libraries.

    \mainclass
    \ingroup plugins

    An instance of a QLibrary object can handle a single shared
    library and provide access to the functionality in the library in
    a platform independent way. If the library is a component server,
    QLibrary provides access to the exported component and can
    directly query this component for interfaces.

    QLibrary ensures that the shared library is loaded and stays in
    memory whilst it is in use. QLibrary can also unload the library
    on destruction and release unused resources.

    A typical use of QLibrary is to resolve an exported symbol in a
    shared object, and to call the function that this symbol
    represents. This is called "explicit linking" in contrast to
    "implicit linking", which is done by the link step in the build
    process when linking an executable against a library.

    The following code snippet loads a library, resolves the symbol
    "mysymbol", and calls the function if everything succeeded. If
    something went wrong, e.g. the library file does not exist or the
    symbol is not defined, the function pointer will be 0 and won't be
    called. When the QLibrary object is destroyed the library will be
    unloaded, making all references to memory allocated in the library
    invalid.

    \code
    typedef void (*MyPrototype)();
    MyPrototype myFunction;

    QLibrary myLib( "mylib" );
    myFunction = (MyPrototype) myLib.resolve( "mysymbol" );
    if ( myFunction ) {
	myFunction();
    }
    \endcode
*/

/*!
    Creates a QLibrary object for the shared library \a filename. The
    library will be unloaded in the destructor.

    Note that \a filename does not need to include the (platform specific)
    file extension, so calling
    \code
    QLibrary lib( "mylib" );
    \endcode
    is equivalent to calling
    \code
    QLibrary lib( "mylib.dll" );
    \endcode
    on Windows, and
    \code
    QLibrary lib( "libmylib.so" );
    \endcode
    on Unix. Specifying the extension is not recommended, since
    doing so introduces a platform dependency.

    If \a filename does not include a path, the library loader will
    look for the file in the platform specific search paths.

    \sa load() unload(), setAutoUnload()
*/
QLibrary::QLibrary( const QString& filename )
    : libfile( filename ), aunload( TRUE )
{
    libfile.replace( '\\', '/' );
    d = new QLibraryPrivate( this );
}

/*!
    Deletes the QLibrary object.

    The library will be unloaded if autoUnload() is TRUE (the
    default), otherwise it stays in memory until the application
    exits.

    \sa unload(), setAutoUnload()
*/
QLibrary::~QLibrary()
{
    if ( autoUnload() )
	unload();

    delete d;
}

/*!
    Returns the address of the exported symbol \a symb. The library is
    loaded if necessary. The function returns 0 if the symbol could
    not be resolved or the library could not be loaded.

    \code
    typedef int (*avgProc)( int, int );

    avgProc avg = (avgProc) library->resolve( "avg" );
    if ( avg )
	return avg( 5, 8 );
    else
	return -1;
    \endcode

    The symbol must be exported as a C-function from the library. This
    requires the \c {extern "C"} notation if the library is compiled
    with a C++ compiler. On Windows you also have to explicitly export
    the function from the DLL using the \c {__declspec(dllexport)}
    compiler directive.

    \code
    extern "C" MY_EXPORT_MACRO int avg(int a, int b)
    {
	return (a + b) / 2;
    }
    \endcode

    with \c MY_EXPORT defined as

    \code
    #ifdef Q_WS_WIN
    # define MY_EXPORT __declspec(dllexport)
    #else
    # define MY_EXPORT
    #endif
    \endcode

    On Darwin and Mac OS X this function uses code from dlcompat, part of the
    OpenDarwin project.

    \overload

    Loads the library \a filename and returns the address of the
    exported symbol \a symb. Note that like the constructor, \a
    filename does not need to include the (platform specific) file
    extension. The library remains loaded until the process exits.

    The function returns 0 if the symbol could not be resolved or the
    library could not be loaded.

    This function is useful only if you want to resolve a single
    symbol, e.g. a function pointer from a specific library once:

    \code
    typedef void (*FunctionType)();
    static FunctionType *ptrFunction = 0;
    static bool triedResolve = FALSE;
    if ( !ptrFunction && !triedResolve )
	ptrFunction = QLibrary::resolve( "mylib", "mysymb" );

    if ( ptrFunction )
	ptrFunction();
    else
	...
    \endcode

    If you want to resolve multiple symbols, use a QLibrary object and
    call the non-static version of resolve().

    \sa resolve()
*/

    Returns TRUE if the library is loaded; otherwise returns FALSE.

    \sa unload()
*/
bool QLibrary::isLoaded() const
{
    return d->pHnd != 0;
}

/*!
    Loads the library. Since resolve() always calls this function
    before resolving any symbols it is not necessary to call it
    explicitly. In some situations you might want the library loaded
    in advance, in which case you would use this function.

    On Darwin and Mac OS X this function uses code from dlcompat, part of the
    OpenDarwin project.
