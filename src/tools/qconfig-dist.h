 Empty leaves all features enabled. See doc/html/features.html for choices.

 Note that disabling some features will produce a libqt that is not
 compatible with other libqt builds. Such modifications are only
 supported on Qt/Embedded where reducing the library size is important
 and where the application-suite is often a fixed set.
