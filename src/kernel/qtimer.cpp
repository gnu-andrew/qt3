    \class QTimer qtimer.h
    \brief The QTimer class provides timer signals and single-shot timers.

    \ingroup time
    \ingroup events
    \mainclass

    It uses \link QTimerEvent timer events\endlink internally to
    provide a more versatile timer. QTimer is very easy to use:
    create a QTimer, call start() to start it and connect its
    timeout() to the appropriate slots. When the time is up it will
    emit the timeout() signal.

    Note that a QTimer object is destroyed automatically when its
    parent object is destroyed.

    Example:
    \code
	QTimer *timer = new QTimer( myObject );
	connect( timer, SIGNAL(timeout()), myObject, SLOT(timerDone()) );
	timer->start( 2000, TRUE ); // 2 seconds single-shot timer
    \endcode

    You can also use the static singleShot() function to create a
    single shot timer.

    As a special case, a QTimer with timeout 0 times out as soon as
    all the events in the window system's event queue have been
    processed.

    This can be used to do heavy work while providing a snappy
    user interface:
    \code
	QTimer *t = new QTimer( myObject );
	connect( t, SIGNAL(timeout()), SLOT(processOneThing()) );
	t->start( 0, FALSE );
    \endcode

    myObject->processOneThing() will be called repeatedly and should
    return quickly (typically after processing one data item) so that
    Qt can deliver events to widgets and stop the timer as soon as it
    has done all its work. This is the traditional way of
    implementing heavy work in GUI applications; multi-threading is
    now becoming available on more and more platforms, and we expect
    that null events will eventually be replaced by threading.

    Note that QTimer's accuracy depends on the underlying operating
    system and hardware. Most platforms support an accuracy of 20ms;
    some provide more. If Qt is unable to deliver the requested
    number of timer clicks, it will silently discard some.

    An alternative to using QTimer is to call QObject::startTimer()
    for your object and reimplement the QObject::timerEvent() event
    handler in your class (which must, of course, inherit QObject).
    The disadvantage is that timerEvent() does not support such
    high-level features as single-shot timers or signals.

    Some operating systems limit the number of timers that may be
    used; Qt tries to work around these limitations.

/*!
    This static function calls a slot after a given time interval.

    It is very convenient to use this function because you do not need
    to bother with a \link QObject::timerEvent() timerEvent\endlink or
    to create a local QTimer object.

    Example:
    \code
	#include <qapplication.h>
	#include <qtimer.h>

	int main( int argc, char **argv )
	{
	    QApplication a( argc, argv );
	    QTimer::singleShot( 10*60*1000, &a, SLOT(quit()) );
		... // create and show your widgets
	    return a.exec();
	}
    \endcode

    This sample program automatically terminates after 10 minutes (i.e.
    600000 milliseconds).

    The \a receiver is the receiving object and the \a member is the
    slot. The time interval is \a msec.

    }
    sst->start(msec, receiver, member);
