This directory contains the source code for the Qt Meta Object
Compiler (moc).

The files moc_yacc.cpp, moc_yacc.h and moc_lex.cpp are generated by
lex and yacc from moc.l and moc.y.

To compile the moc program from scratch, you need lex and yacc. These
tools are preinstalled on most Unix systems, often as symbolic links
to flex and byacc or bison.

If you run Windows, you can install the Cygwin32 package available at
ftp://ftp.cygnus.com/pub/gnu-win32/win32.
