			  INSTALLING Qt/X11 Version 3.3.8


You may need to be logged in as root, depending on the permissions of
the directories where you choose to install Qt.


1.  Unpack the archive if you have not done so already:

	cd /usr/local
	gunzip qt-x11-free-3.3.8.tar.gz	# uncompress the archive
	tar xvf qt-x11-free-3.3.8.tar	# unpack it

    This creates the directory /usr/local/qt-x11-free-3.3.8 containing the
    files from the main archive.

    Rename qt-x11-free-3.3.8 to qt (or make a symlink):

	mv qt-x11-free-3.3.8 qt

    The rest of this file assumes that Qt is installed in /usr/local/qt.


2.  Set some environment variables in the file .profile (or .login,
    depending on your shell) in your home directory. Create the
    file if it is not there already.

	QTDIR		   - the directory in which you're building Qt
	PATH		   - to locate the moc program and other Qt tools
	MANPATH 	   - to access the Qt man pages
	LD_LIBRARY_PATH	   - for the shared Qt library

    Note that under IRIX the additional LD_LIBRARYN32_PATH and
    LD_LIBRARY64_PATH variables are used for specifying library
    search paths. Set the variable that matches your configuration, or
    see the rld(5) man page for more information.
    On AIX set LIBPATH and on HP-UX set SHLIB_PATH instead of LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

    This is done like this:

    In .profile (if your shell is bash, ksh, zsh or sh), add the
    following lines:

	QTDIR=/usr/local/qt
	PATH=$QTDIR/bin:$PATH
	MANPATH=$QTDIR/doc/man:$MANPATH
	LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$QTDIR/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

	export QTDIR PATH MANPATH LD_LIBRARY_PATH

    In .login (in case your shell is csh or tcsh), add the following lines:

	setenv QTDIR /usr/local/qt
	setenv PATH $QTDIR/bin:$PATH
	setenv MANPATH $QTDIR/doc/man:$MANPATH
	setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH $QTDIR/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

    After you have done this, you will need to login again, or
    re-source the profile before continuing, so that at least $QTDIR
    and $PATH are set. Without these the installation will halt with an error
    message.

    Note that the SGI MIPSpro o32 and Sun WorkShop 5.0 targets are no
    longer supported as of Qt 3.3.

3.  Install your license file as $HOME/.qt-license.
    For the free edition and evaluation version, you do not need a license
    file.


4.  Building.

    This step compiles the Qt library, and builds the example programs,
    the tutorial, and the tools (e.g. Qt Designer).

    Type:

	./configure

    This will configure the Qt library for your machine. Note that
    GIF support is turned off by default. Run ./configure -help
    to get a list of configuration options. Read PLATFORMS for a
    list of supported platforms.

    To create the library and compile all the examples and the
    tutorial, type:

	make

    If your platform or compiler is not supported, please contact us at
    qt-bugs@trolltech.com so that we can assist you. If it is supported
    but you have problems, see http://www.trolltech.com/platforms/ for
    information on known issues.


    At this point you have binaries created in $QTDIR (eg. $QTDIR/lib/
    contains libqt.so). If, however, you would like to have your Qt
    installed in a non-local installation you can run configure with
    options splitting Qt into different areas for example:

        ./configure -libdir /usr/local/lib -bindir /usr/local/bin -headerdir /usr/local/include/qt

    If you supplied a custom install directory using the -prefix
    parameter in step 2, you can:

	make install

    This will install Qt onto your machine using the paths you've set.
    (See ./configure -help for more information). If you choose to
    install Qt like this, remember that you must set your
    LD_LIBRARY_PATH to match your -libdir and your QTDIR to your
    -headerdir (as described in (2) above).


5.  In very few cases you may need to run /sbin/ldconfig or something
    similar at this point if you are using shared libraries.

    If you have problems running the example programs, e.g. messages like

	 can't load library 'libqt.so.3'

    you probably need to put a reference to the qt library in a
    configuration file and run /sbin/ldconfig as root on your system.
    And don't forget to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH as explained in (2) above.


6.  The online HTML documentation is installed in /usr/local/qt/doc/html/
    The main page is /usr/local/qt/doc/html/index.html
    The man pages are installed in /usr/local/qt/doc/man/



That's all.  Qt is now installed.
