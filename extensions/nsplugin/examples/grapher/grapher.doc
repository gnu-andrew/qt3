  \title Grapher Plugin

  This example graphs data from a simple text file.  It
  demonstrates the use of the QNPInstance::writeReady()
  and QNPInstance::write() functions.

  To build the example, you must first build the
  <a href=nsplugin.html>Qt Netscape Plugin Extension</a> library.
  Then type <tt>make</tt> in <tt>extensions/nsplugin/examples/grapher/</tt>
  and copy the resulting <tt>grapher.so</tt> or <tt>npgrapher.dll</tt>
  to the Plugins directory of your WWW browser.

  <EMBED ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=49% HEIGHT=300 SRC=graph.g1n
    graphstyle=pie fontfamily=times fontsize=18>

  The text file it accepts as input has a title line, then
  a sequence of lines with a number, then a string.  The
  plugin displays a pie chart of the numbers, each segment
  labelled by the associated string.  The user can select
  a bar chart view of the same data by selecting from the
  menu that appears when they point at the plugin.

  The HTML tag used to embed the graph is:
<small>
<pre>
  &lt;EMBED
    SRC=graph.g1n
    ALIGN=LEFT
    WIDTH=49% HEIGHT=300
    graphstyle=pie fontfamily=times
    fontsize=18&gt;
</pre>
</small>
  Note that some HTML arguments (which we have capitalized here)
  are interpreted by the browser, while others are used by the
  plugin.

<br clear>
With the simplicity and cross-platform nature of Qt-based plugins,
pages like <a href="http://www.netcraft.com/survey/">Netcraft's
Server Graphs</a> can be provided much more efficiently for both
the service provider and consumer.  Data need not be converted
to an image at the server.
