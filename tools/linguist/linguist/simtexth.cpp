/*
  How similar are two texts?  The approach used here relies on co-occurrence
  matrices and is very efficient.

  Let's see with an example: how similar are "here" and "hither"?  The
  co-occurrence matrix M for "here" is M[h,e] = 1, M[e,r] = 1, M[r,e] = 1, and 0
  elsewhere; the matrix N for "hither" is N[h,i] = 1, N[i,t] = 1, ...,
  N[h,e] = 1, N[e,r] = 1, and 0 elsewhere.  The union U of both matrices is the
  matrix U[i,j] = max { M[i,j], N[i,j] }, and the intersection V is
  V[i,j] = min { M[i,j], N[i,j] }.  The score for a pair of texts is

      score = (sum of V[i,j] over all i, j) / (sum of U[i,j] over all i, j),

  a formula suggested by Arnt Gulbrandsen.  Here we have

      score = 2 / 6,

  or one third.

  The implementation differs from this in a few details.  Most importantly,
  repetitions are ignored; for input "xxx", M[x,x] equals 1, not 2.
*/

/*
  Every character is assigned to one of 20 buckets so that the co-occurrence
  matrix requires only 20 * 20 = 400 bits, not 256 * 256 = 65536 bits or even
  more if we want the whole Unicode.  Which character falls in which bucket is
  arbitrary.

  The second half of the table is a replica of the first half, because of
  laziness.
