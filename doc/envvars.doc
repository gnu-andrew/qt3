\title Qt/Embedded environment variables

\table
\header \i Variable \i Notes

\row
\i QWS_SW_CURSOR
\i If defined, always use a software mouse cursor even when using an
accelerated driver that supports a hardware cursor

\row
\i QWS_DISPLAY
\i Defines the display type and framebuffer, e.g.
\c{Voodoo3 Mach64:/dev/fb1}
Defaults to an unaccelerated Linux framebuffer driver on \c /dev/fb0.
Valid drivers are QVfb, VGA16, LinuxFb (unaccelerated Linux framebuffer),
Mach64 (accelerated for ATI Mach64 cards such as the Rage Pro),
Voodoo3 (accelerated for the 3dfx Voodoo 3, should also work on Voodoo
Banshee), Matrox (should work on all Matrox graphics cards since the
Matrox Millennium), Transformed (for rotated displays), SVGALIB and
VNC. Transformed displays have a special format: within the
specification should be a multiple of 90 degrees rotation specified as
Rot\<x\>, for instance Transformed:Rot90.

\row
\i QTDIR
\i If defined this tells Qt/Embedded to where to find its fonts:
fontdir should be in \c $QTDIR/etc/fonts/. If undefined it's assumed
to be \c /usr/local/qt-embedded

\row
\i QWS_SIZE
\i If defined forces Qt/Embedded into a window of \<width\> x
\<height\> size centred within the screen, e.g. 320x200

\row
\i QWS_NOMTRR
\i If defined, don't use Memory Type Range Registers to define the framebuffer
as write-combined on x86. Write-combining speeds up graphics output.

\row
\i QWS_CARD_SLOT
\i Tells the accelerated drivers which card to attempt to accelerate.
This should be a path in \c /proc/bus/pci. It defaults to
\c /proc/bus/pci/01/00.0 - the first device on the second PCI bus in the
system, which is normally the AGP card.

\row
\i QWS_USB_KEYBOARD
\i If defined, instead of opening \c /dev/tty open the USB low-level
event device defined in QWS_USB_KEYBOARD (e.g. \c /dev/input/event0):
this is useful if you wish to run X and Qt/Embedded side by side on
different framebuffers.

\row
\i QWS_MOUSE_PROTO
\i Defined as \<type\>:\<device\>, e.g. \c{Microsoft:/dev/ttyS0}. If you want to
use a USB mouse directly (separate from X) use \c{MouseMan:/dev/input/mouse0}
or similar. Valid mouse protocls are Auto (automatically sense protocol),
MouseMan, IntelliMouse, Microsoft, QVfbMouse (only useful with QVfb)
and TPanel, a sample touch panel driver.

\row
\i QWS_KEYBOARD
\i Defines the keyboard type. Multiple keyboards can be handled at once,
input will be read from all of them. Valid values:
Buttons (an iPaq button device if QT_QWS_IPAQ is compiled, otherwise
one for the Cassiopeia), QVfbKeyboard (only useful with QVfb),
and TTY (either a USB keyboard or \c /dev/tty depending if QWS_USB_KEYBOARD
is defined)
