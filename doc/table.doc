\title Table Module

\if defined(commercial)
This module is part of the \link commercialeditions.html Qt Enterprise
Edition\endlink.
\endif

The table module provides a flexible and editable table widget, \l
QTable. For many applications QTables can be used directly and simply,
providing a grid of editable cells. QTable can also be subclassed in a
straightforward way to provide very large sparse tables, e.g. one
million by one million cells.

The table module provides the following classes:
\list
\i \l QTable itself is the widget of choice whenever you need to
    provide your users with the ability to display and edit
  tabular data such as spreadsheet or database data.
\i \l QTableItem objects are used to populate a QTable with data with
each table item holding the contents of a cell. 
\i The \l QComboTableItem class provides memory-efficient combobox items for QTables. 
\i The \l QCheckTableItem class provides memory-efficient checkbox items for QTables.
\i \l QTableSelection provides access to selections of cells in a QTable.  
\i QHeader provides access to the table's horizontal header (column
headers) and vertical header (row headers).
\endlist

See the appropriate class documentation for details and refer to the
