.SH SYNOPSIS
.B lupdate
.RI "[ " options " ] " project-file

.B lupdate
.RI "[ " options " ] " source-files " -ts " ts-files
.SH DESCRIPTION
This page documents the
.B Qt Linguist Update
tool for the Qt GUI toolkit.
.B Lupdate
reads a qmake/tmake project file (.pro file), finds the translatable
strings in the specified source, header and interface files, and
updates the translation files (.ts files) specified in it. The
translation files are given to the translator who uses
.B Qt Linguist
to read the files and insert the translations.
.PP
The .ts file format is a simple human-readable XML format that can be
used with version control systems if required.
