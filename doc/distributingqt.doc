\title Deploying Qt Applications

This document lists the platform-specific files needed to distribute
Qt applications. We do not include any compiler-specific files that
may also be required. (See also, \link winsystem.html Window
System-specific Notes\endlink.)

\tableofcontents

\section1 Static Qt Applications

To distribute static Qt applications, you need the following file for
all platforms:

\list
\i your application's executable
\endlist

\section1 Dynamic Qt Applications

To distribute dynamic Qt applications, you will need the following
files for all platforms:

\list
\i application executable
\i the Qt library 
\endlist

The Qt library must either be in the same directory as the application
executable or in a directory which is included in the system library
path.

The library is in provided by the following platform specific files:

\table
\header \i Platform \i File
\row \i Windows \i \c qt[version].dll
\row \i Unix/Linux \i \c libqt[version].so
\row \i Mac \i \c libqt[version].dylib
\endtable

\e version includes the three version numbers. For threaded builds the
version is prefixed with \e {-mt}.

\section2 Distributing Plugins

You must include any plugin files required by the application.

Plugins must be put into a subdirectory under a directory known to
Qt as a plugin directory. The subdirectory must have the name of the
plugin category (e.g. \c styles, \c sqldrivers, \c designer, etc.). 

Qt searches in the following directories for plugin categories:

\list
\i Application specific plugin paths
\i Build-directory of Qt
\i The application directory
\endlist

Application specific plugin paths can be added using 
QApplication::addLibraryPath(). The build-directory of Qt is hardcoded
in the Qt library and can be changed as a part of the installation
process (see the \l distributor-example.html Distributor example).

\section1 Dynamic Dialogs 

For dynamic dialogs if you use QWidgetFactory, you need the following
files for all platforms:

\list
\i The same files as used for dynamic Qt applications
\i The QUI Library
\endlist

The QUI library is provided by the following platform specific files:
\table
\header \i Platform \i File
\row \i Windows  \i\c qui.lib
\row \i Unix/Linux  \i\c libqui.so
\row \i Mac \i \c libqui.dylib
\endtable

The QUI library must either be in the same directory as the
application executable or in a directory which is included in the
system library path.
