<p> We assume that you already know C++!
<p> The best way to learn Qt is to read the official Qt book, <a
href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0131240722/trolltech/">
C++ GUI Programming with Qt 3 (ISBN 0-13-124072-2)</a>.

This book provides comprehensive coverage of Qt programming all the
way from "Hello Qt" to advanced features like multithreading, 2D and
3D graphics, networking, and XML.
<p> <a href="http://www.trolltech.com/training/">http://www.trolltech.com/training/</a>{Qt and Qtopia training} is also
available. This takes the form of open enrollment courses for the
public and on-site training for you and your colleagues.
<p> If you can't get hold of the official book, or if you can't wait for
it to arrive then here is our suggested learning programme.
<p> Read the <a href="http://www.trolltech.com/products/qt/whitepaper.html">Qt Whitepaper</a> first. This provides an overview of Qt's
facilities and has snippets of code which demonstrate the Qt approach
to programming. It gives you the 'big picture'.
<p> If you want to program purely in C++, designing your interfaces in
code without the aid of any design tools, read the tutorials. <a href="tutorial.html">Tutorial #1</a> is designed to get you into Qt
programming, with the emphasis on working code rather than being a
tour of features. <a href="tutorial2.html">Tutorial #2</a> presents a
more realistic example, demonstrating how to code menus, toolbars,
file loading and saving, dialogs, etc.
<p> If you want to design your user interfaces using a design tool, then
read at least the first few chapters of the <a href="designer-manual.html">Qt Designer manual</a>. After this, it is still worthwhile trying
the pure C++ Tutorials (<a href="tutorial.html">Tutorial #1</a> and
<a href="tutorial2.html">Tutorial #2</a>) mentioned above.
<p> By now you'll have produced some small working applications and have a
broad feel for Qt programming. You could start work on your own
projects straight away, but we recommend reading a couple of key
overviews to deepen your understanding of Qt: the <a href="object.html">Qt Object Model</a> and <a href="signalsandslots.html">Signals and Slots</a>. 
<p> At this point we recommend looking at the <a href="overviews-list.html">overviews</a> and reading those that are relevant to your
projects. You may also find it useful to browse the source code of the
<a href="examples.html">examples</a> that have things in common with
your projects. You can also read Qt's source code since this is
supplied. 
<p> If you run the <tt>demo</tt> application (in <tt>$QTDIR/examples/demo</tt>)
you'll see many of Qt's widgets in action.
<p> Qt comes with extensive documentation, with hypertext cross-references
throughout, so you can easily click your way to whatever interests
you. The part of the documentation that you'll probably use the most
is the <a href="index.html">API Reference</a>. Each link provides a
different way of navigating the API Reference; try them all to see
which work best for you. You might also like to try <a href="assistant.html">Qt Assistant</a>: this tool is supplied with Qt and
provides access to the entire Qt API, and it provides a full text
search facility. There are also a growing number of <a href="http://www.trolltech.com/developer/books.html">Qt
books</a>.
<p> You should now be ready to ground-break: good luck, and have fun!
