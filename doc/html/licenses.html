Qt contains a little code that is not under the <a href="license.html">QPL</a>, the <a href="gpl.html">GPL</a>, or the Qt Commercial
License Agreement, but rather under specific highly permissive
licenses from the original authors. This page lists the licenses used
for that code, names the authors, and links to the points where it is
used.
<p> Trolltech gratefully acknowledges these and others contribution to
Qt.  We recommend that all programs that use Qt also acknowledge these
contributions, and quote all these license statements in an appendix
to the documentation.

<p> TrueType font support. These functions allow PPR to generate
PostScript fonts from Microsoft compatible TrueType font files.
<p> The functions in this file do most of the work to convert a
TrueType font to a type 3 PostScript font.
<p> Most of the material in this file is derived from a program called
"ttf2ps" which L. S. Ng posted to the usenet news group
"comp.sources.postscript". The author did not provide a copyright
notice or indicate any restrictions on use.

<p> Qt supports GIF reading if it is configured that way during
installation (see qgif.h). If it is, we are required to state that
"The Graphics Interchange Format(c) is the Copyright property of
CompuServe Incorporated. GIF(sm) is a Service Mark property of
CompuServe Incorporated."
<p> <b>Warning:</b> If you are in a country that recognizes software patents
and in which Unisys holds a patent on LZW compression and/or
decompression and you want to use GIF, Unisys may require you to
license that technology. Such countries include Canada, Japan,
the USA, France, Germany, Italy and the UK.
<p> GIF support may be removed completely in a future version of Qt.
We recommend using the MNG or PNG format.<ul>
