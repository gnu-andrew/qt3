</ul><a name="About"></a><h3><a name="2"></a>About This Reference</h3>
<p>This reference is a detailed index of all command line options, configurations and internal variables used by the cross-platform makefile generation utility <em>qmake</em>.</p>
<p>In addition to the variables and functions described in the following sections, <em>qmake</em> project files may also include comments. Comments begin with the '#' symbol and run to the end of the line.</p>
<a name="Commands"></a><h3><a name="3"></a>Command Line Options</h3>
<h4><a name="3-1"></a>Syntax</h4>
<pre>
qmake [options] files
</pre>
<h4><a name="3-2"></a>Options</h4>
<p>The following options can be specified on the command line to <em>qmake</em>:</p>
<ul><li><p><tt>-o</tt> file <br> <em>qmake</em> output will be directed to <em>file</em>. if this argument is not specified, then <em>qmake</em> will try to guess a suitable name. If '-' is specified, output is directed to stdout.</p>
<li><p><tt>-unix</tt> <br> <em>qmake</em> will run in unix mode. In this mode, Unix file naming and path conventions will be used, additionally testing for unix (as a scope) will succeed. This is the default mode on all Unices.</p>
<li><p><tt>-macx</tt> <br> <em>qmake</em> will run in Mac OS X mode. In this mode, Unix file naming and path conventions will be used, additionally testing for macx (as a scope) will succeed. This is the default mode on Mac OS X.</p>
<li><p><tt>-win32</tt> <br> <em>qmake</em> will run in win32 mode. In this mode, Windows file naming and path conventions will be used, additionally testing for win32 (as a scope) will succeed. This is the default mode on Windows.</p>
<li><p><tt>-d</tt> <br> <em>qmake</em> will output (hopefully) useful debugging information.</p>
<li><p><tt>-t</tt> tmpl <br> <em>qmake</em> will override any set TEMPLATE variables with tmpl, but only <em>after</em> the .pro file has been processed.</p>
<li><p><tt>-tp</tt> prefix <br> <em>qmake</em> will add the prefix to the TEMPLATE variable.</p>
<li><p><tt>-help</tt> <br> <em>qmake</em> will go over these features and give some useful help.</p>
</ul><p>There are also warning options that can help to find problems in your project file:</p>
<ul><li><p><tt>-Wall</tt> <br> With this <em>qmake</em> will turn on all known warnings.</p>
<li><p><tt>-Wnone</tt> <br> No warning information will be generated by <em>qmake</em>.</p>
<li><p><tt>-Wparser</tt> <br> <em>qmake</em> will only generate parser warnings, this will alert you to common pitfalls, and potential problems in the parsing of your .pro files.</p>
<li><p><tt>-Wlogic</tt> <br> Again <em>qmake</em> will warn of common pitfalls, and potential problems. This can include (but not limited to) checking if a file is placed into a list of files multiple times, if a file cannot be found, etc.</p>
</ul><p><em>qmake</em> supports two different modes of operation. The first mode, which is the default is makefile generation. In this mode, <em>qmake</em> will take a .pro file and turn it into a makefile. Creating makefiles is covered by this reference guide, there is another mode which generates .pro files.</p>
<p>To toggle between these modes you must specify in the first argument what mode you want to use. If no mode is specified, <em>qmake</em> will assume you want makefile mode. The available modes are:</p>
<ul><li><p><tt>-makefile</tt> <br> <em>qmake</em> output will be a makefile (<a href="qmake-manual-8.html#MakefileMode">Makefile mode</a>).</p>
<li><p><tt>-project</tt> <br> <em>qmake</em> output will be a project file (<a href="qmake-manual-8.html#ProjectfileMode">Project file mode</a>).</p>
</ul><a name="MakefileMode"></a><h5><a name="3-2-1"></a>Makefile Mode</h5>
<p>In Makefile mode <em>qmake</em> will generate a makefile. Additionally you may supply the following arguments in this mode:</p>
<ul><li><p><tt>-after</tt> <br> <em>qmake</em> will process assignments given on the commandline after the specified files.</p>
<li><p><tt>-nocache</tt> <br> <em>qmake</em> will ignore the .qmake.cache file.</p>
<li><p><tt>-nodepend</tt> <br> <em>qmake</em> will not generate any dependency information.</p>
<li><p><tt>-cache</tt> file <br> <em>qmake</em> will use <em>file</em> as the cache file, ignoring any other .qmake.cache file found</p>
<li><p><tt>-spec</tt> spec <br> <em>qmake</em> will use <em>spec</em> as a path to platform-compiler information and QMAKESPEC will be ignored.</p>
</ul><p>The <tt>files</tt> argument can be a list of one or more project files, separated by spaces. You may also pass qmake assignments on the command line here and they will be processed before all files specified, for example:</p>
<p>qmake -makefile -unix -o Makefile "CONFIG+=test" test.pro</p>
<p>If however you are certain you want your variables processed after the the files specified, then you may pass the -after argument. When this is specified all assignments on the commandline after the -after option will be postponed until after the specified files are parsed.</p>
<p>This will generate a Makefile, from test.pro with Unix pathnames. However many of these arguments aren't necessary as they are the default. Therefore the line can be simplified on Unix to:</p>
<p>qmake "CONFIG+=test" test.pro</p>
<a name="ProjectfileMode"></a><h5><a name="3-2-2"></a>Projectfile Mode</h5>
<p>In Projectfile mode <em>qmake</em> will generate a project file. Additionally, you may supply the following arguments in this mode:</p>
<ul><li><p><tt>-r</tt> <br> <em>qmake</em> will look through supplied directories recursively</p>
<li><p><tt>-nopwd</tt> <br> <em>qmake</em> will not look in your current working directory for source code and only use the specified <tt>files</tt></p>
</ul><p>The <tt>files</tt> argument can be a list of files or directories. If a directory is specified, then it will be included in the <a href="qmake-manual-8.html#DEPENDPATH">DEPENDPATH</a> variable and relevant code from there will be included in the generated project file, if a file is given it will go into the correct variable depending on extension (i.e. .ui files go into FORMS, .cpp files go into SOURCES, etc). Here too you may pass assignments on the commandline, when doing so these assignments will be placed last in the generated .pro file.</p>
<a name="SystemVariables"></a><h3><a name="4"></a>System Variables</h3>
<ul><li><p><a href="qmake-manual-8.html#FrequentlyUsedSystemVariables">Frequently Used System Variables</a></p>
<li><p><a href="qmake-manual-8.html#RarelyUsedSystemVariables">Rarely Used System Variables</a></p>
</ul><a name="FrequentlyUsedSystemVariables"></a><h4><a name="4-1"></a>Frequently Used System Variables</h4>
<p>The following variables are recognized by <em>qmake</em> and are used most frequently when creating project files.</p>
<a name="CONFIG"></a><h5><a name="4-1-1"></a>CONFIG</h5>
<p>The <tt>CONFIG</tt> variable specifies project configuration and compiler options. The values will be recognized internally by <em>qmake</em> and have special meaning. They are as follows.</p>
<p>These <tt>CONFIG</tt> values control compilation flags:</p>
<ul><li><p>release - Compile with optimization enabled, ignored if "debug" is specified</p>
<li><p>debug - Compile with debug options enabled</p>
<li><p>warn_on - The compiler should emit more warnings than normally, ignored if "warn_off" is specified</p>
<li><p>warn_off - The compiler should only emit severe warnings.</p>
</ul><p>These options define the application/library type:</p>
<ul><li><p>qt - The target is a Qt application/library and requires the Qt header files/library. The proper include and library paths for the Qt library will automatically be added to the project.</p>
<li><p>opengl - The target requires the OpenGL (or Mesa) headers/libraries. The proper include and library paths for these libraries will automatically be added to the project.</p>
<li><p>thread - The target is a multi-threaded application or library. The proper defines and compiler flags will automatically be added to the project.</p>
<li><p>x11 - The target is a X11 application or library. The proper include paths and libraries will automatically be added to the project.</p>
<li><p>windows - The target is a Win32 window application (app only). The proper include paths,compiler flags and libraries will automatically be added to the project.</p>
<li><p>console - The target is a Win32 console application (app only). The proper include paths, compiler flags and libraries will automatically be added to the project.</p>
<li><p>dll - The target is a shared object/DLL.The proper include paths, compiler flags and libraries will automatically be added to the project.</p>
<li><p>staticlib - The target is a static library (lib only). The proper compiler flags will automatically be added to the project.</p>
<li><p>plugin - The target is a plugin (lib only). This enables dll as well.</p>
</ul><p>These options are used to set the compiler flags:</p>
<ul><li><p>exceptions - Exception support is enabled</p>
<li><p>rtti - RTTI support is enabled</p>
<li><p>stl - STL support is enabled</p>
</ul><p>These options define specific things depending on the platform and/or template:</p>
<ul><li><p>flat - When using the vcapp template this will put all the source files into the source group and the header files into the header group regardless of what directory they reside in. Turning this option off will group the files within the source/header group depending on the directory they reside. This is turned on by default.</p>
</ul><p>The <tt>CONFIG</tt> variable will also be checked when resolving scopes. You may assign anything to this variable.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre>
CONFIG += qt console newstuff
...
newstuff {
        SOURCES += new.cpp
        HEADERS += new.h
}
</pre>
<a name="DEFINES"></a><h5><a name="4-1-2"></a>DEFINES</h5>
<p><em>qmake</em> adds the values of this variable as compiler C preprocessor macros (-D option).</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre> 
DEFINES += USE_MY_STUFF QT_DLL
</pre>
<a name="DEF_FILE"></a><h5><a name="4-1-3"></a>DEF_FILE</h5>
<p><em>This is only used on Windows when using the 'app' template</em>.</p>
<p>Specifies a .def file to be included in the project.</p>
<a name="DESTDIR"></a><h5><a name="4-1-4"></a>DESTDIR</h5>
<p>Specifies where to put the <a href="qmake-manual-8.html#TARGET">target</a> file.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre> 
  DESTDIR = ../../lib
</pre>
<a name="DLLDESTDIR"></a><h5><a name="4-1-5"></a>DLLDESTDIR</h5>
<p>Specifies where to copy the <a href="qmake-manual-8.html#TARGET">target</a> dll.</p>
<a name="HEADERS"></a><h5><a name="4-1-6"></a>HEADERS</h5>
<p>Defines the header files for the project.</p>
<p><em>qmake</em> will generate dependency information (unless -nodepend is specified on the <a href="qmake-manual-8.html#Commands">command line</a>) for the specified headers. <em>qmake</em> will also automatically detect if <em>moc</em> is required by the classes in these headers, and add the appropriate dependencies and files to the project for generating and linking the moc files.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre>
HEADERS = myclass.h \
          login.h \
          mainwindow.h
</pre>
<p>See also <a href="qmake-manual-8.html#SOURCES">SOURCES</a>.</p>
<a name="INCLUDEPATH"></a><h5><a name="4-1-7"></a>INCLUDEPATH</h5>
<p>This variable specifies the #include directories which should be searched when compiling the project. Use ';' or a space as the directory separator.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre>
  INCLUDEPATH = c:\msdev\include d:\stl\include
</pre>
<a name="FORMS"></a><h5><a name="4-1-8"></a>FORMS</h5>
<p>This variable specifies the .ui files (see <a href="designer-manual.html">Qt Designer</a>) to be processed through <em>uic</em> before compiling. All dependencies, headers and source files required to build these .ui files will automatically be added to the project.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre>
FORMS = mydialog.ui \
        mywidget.ui \
        myconfig.ui
</pre>
<p>Note that forms should not be specified using the <tt>+=</tt> operator because this syntax is not fully supported by <em>Qt Designer</em>.</p>
<a name="LEXSOURCES"></a><h5><a name="4-1-9"></a>LEXSOURCES</h5>
<p>This variable contains a list of lex source files. All dependencies, headers and source files will automatically be added to the project for building these lex files.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre>
LEXSOURCES = lexer.l
</pre>
<a name="LIBS"></a><h5><a name="4-1-10"></a>LIBS</h5>
<p>This variable contains a list of libraries to be linked into the project. If you are more comfortable with the Unix convension of -L/-l flags you are free to use them in a cross-platform manner and qmake will do the correct thing with these libraries on Windows (namely this means passing the full path of the library to the linker). The only limitation to this is the library must exist, for qmake to find which directory a -l lib lives in.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre>
unix:LIBS += -lmath -L/usr/local/lib
win32:LIBS += c:\mylibs\math.lib
</pre>
<a name="MOC_DIR"></a><h5><a name="4-1-11"></a>MOC_DIR</h5>
<p>This variable specifies the directory where all intermediate moc files should be placed.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre>
unix:MOC_DIR = ../myproject/tmp
win32:MOC_DIR = c:\myproject\tmp
</pre>
<a name="OBJECTS_DIR"></a><h5><a name="4-1-12"></a>OBJECTS_DIR</h5>
<p>This variable specifies the directory where all intermediate objects should be placed.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre>
unix:OBJECTS_DIR = ../myproject/tmp
win32:OBJECTS__DIR = c:\myproject\tmp
</pre>
<a name="UI_DIR"></a><h5><a name="4-1-13"></a>UI_DIR</h5>
<p>This variable specifies the directory where all intermediate files from uic should be placed. This variable overrides both UI_SOURCES_DIR and UI_HEADERS_DIR.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre>
unix:UI_DIR = ../myproject/ui
win32:UI_DIR = c:\myproject\ui
</pre>
<a name="UI_HEADERS_DIR"></a><h5><a name="4-1-14"></a>UI_HEADERS_DIR</h5>
<p>This variable specifies the directory where all declaration files (as generated by uic) should be placed.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre>
unix:UI_HEADERS_DIR = ../myproject/ui/include
win32:UI_HEADERS_DIR = c:\myproject\ui\include
</pre>
<a name="UI_SOURCES_DIR"></a><h5><a name="4-1-15"></a>UI_SOURCES_DIR</h5>
<p>This variable specifies the directory where all implementation files (as generated by uic) should be placed.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre>
unix:UI_SOURCES_DIR = ../myproject/ui/src
win32:UI_SOURCES_DIR = c:\myproject\ui\src
</pre>
<a name="REQUIRES"></a><h5><a name="4-1-16"></a>REQUIRES</h5>
<p>This is a special variable processed by <em>qmake</em>. If the contents of this variable do not appear in CONFIG by the time this variable is assigned, then a minimal makefile will be generated that states what dependencies (the values assigned to REQUIRES) are missing.</p>
<p>This is mainly used in Qt's build system for building the examples.</p>
<a name="SOURCES"></a><h5><a name="4-1-17"></a>SOURCES</h5>
<p>This variable contains the name of all source files in the project.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre>
SOURCES = myclass.cpp \
          login.cpp \
          mainwindow.cpp

</pre>
<p>See also <a href="qmake-manual-8.html#HEADERS">HEADERS</a></p>
<h5><a name="4-1-18"></a>SUBDIRS</h5>
<p>This variable, when used with the 'subdirs' <a href="qmake-manual-8.html#TEMPLATE">TEMPLATE</a> contains the names of all subdirectories to look for a project file.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre>
SUBDIRS = kernel \
          tools
</pre>
<a name="TARGET"></a><h5><a name="4-1-19"></a>TARGET</h5>
<p>This specifies the name of the target file.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre>
TEMPLATE = app
TARGET = myapp
SOURCES = main.cpp
</pre>
<p>The project file above would produce an executable named 'myapp' on unix and 'myapp.exe' on windows.</p>
<a name="TEMPLATE"></a><h5><a name="4-1-20"></a>TEMPLATE</h5>
<p>This variable contains the name of the template to use when generating the project. The allowed values are:</p>
<ul><li><p>app - Creates a makefile for building applications (the default)</p>
<li><p>lib - Creates a makefile for building libraries</p>
<li><p>subdirs - Creates a makefile for building targets in subdirectories</p>
<li><p>vcapp - <em>win32 only</em> Creates an application project file for Visual Studio</p>
<li><p>vclib - <em>win32 only</em> Creates a library project file for Visual Studio</p>
</ul><p>For example:</p>
<pre>
TEMPLATE = lib
SOURCES = main.cpp
TARGET = mylib
</pre>
<p>The template can be overridden by specifying a new template type with the <tt>-t</tt> command line option. This overrides the template type <em>after</em> the .pro file has been processed. With .pro files that use the template type to determine how the project is built, it is necessary to declare TEMPLATE on the command line rather than use the <tt>-t</tt> option.</p>
<h5><a name="4-1-21"></a>VERSION</h5>
<p>This variable contains the version number of the library if the 'lib' <a href="qmake-manual-8.html#TEMPLATE">TEMPLATE</a> is specified.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre>
VERSION = 1.2.3
</pre>
<h5><a name="4-1-22"></a>DISTFILES</h5>
<p>This variable contains a list of files to be included in the dist target. This feature is supported by UnixMake specs only.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre>
DISTFILES += ../program.txt
</pre>
<a name="YACCSOURCES"></a><h5><a name="4-1-23"></a>YACCSOURCES</h5>
<p>This variable contains a list of yacc source files to be included in the project. All dependencies, headers and source files will automatically be included in the project.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre>
YACCSOURCES = moc.y
</pre>
<a name="RarelyUsedSystemVariables"></a><h4><a name="4-2"></a>Rarely Used System Variables</h4>
<p>The following variables are also recognized by <em>qmake</em> but are either internal or very rarely used.</p>
<a name="DESTDIR_TARGET"></a><h5><a name="4-2-1"></a>DESTDIR_TARGET</h5>
<p>This variable is set internally by <em>qmake</em>, which is basically the DESTDIR variable with the TARGET variable appened at the end. The value of this variable is typically handled by <em>qmake</em> or <a href="qmake-manual-8.html#QMAKESPEC">qmake.conf</a> and rarely needs to be modified.</p>
<a name="DSP_TEMPLATE"></a><h5><a name="4-2-2"></a>DSP_TEMPLATE</h5>
<p>This variable is set internally by <em>qmake</em>, which specifies where the dsp template file for basing generated dsp files is stored. The value of this variable is typically handled by <em>qmake</em> or <a href="qmake-manual-8.html#QMAKESPEC">qmake.conf</a> and rarely needs to be modified.</p>
<a name="LEXIMPLS"></a><h5><a name="4-2-3"></a>LEXIMPLS</h5>
<p>This variable contains a list of lex implementation files. The value of this variable is typically handled by <em>qmake</em> or <a href="qmake-manual-8.html#QMAKESPEC">qmake.conf</a> and rarely needs to be modified.</p>
<a name="LEXOBJECTS"></a><h5><a name="4-2-4"></a>LEXOBJECTS</h5>
<p>This variable contains the names of intermediate lex object files.The value of this variable is typically handled by <em>qmake</em> and rarely needs to be modified.</p>
<a name="LITERAL_HASH"></a><h5><a name="4-2-5"></a>LITERAL_HASH</h5>
<p>This variable is used whenever a literal hash character (<tt>#</tt>) is needed in a variable declaration, perhaps as part of a file name or in a string passed to some external application.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre>
# To include a literal hash character, use the $$LITERAL_HASH variable:
urlPieces = http://doc.trolltech.com/3.3/qmake-manual-8.html LITERAL_HASH
message($$join(urlPieces, $$LITERAL_HASH))
</pre>
<p>By using <tt>LITERAL_HASH</tt> in this way, the <tt>#</tt> character can be used to construct a URL for the <tt>message()</tt> function to print to the console.</p>
<a name="MAKEFILE"></a><h5><a name="4-2-6"></a>MAKEFILE</h5>
<p>This variable specifies the name of the makefile which <em>qmake</em> should use when outputting the dependency information for building a project. The value of this variable is typically handled by <em>qmake</em> or <a href="qmake-manual-8.html#QMAKESPEC">qmake.conf</a> and rarely needs to be modified.</p>
<a name="MAKEFILE_GENERATOR"></a><h5><a name="4-2-7"></a>MAKEFILE_GENERATOR</h5>
<p>This variable contains the name of the makefile generator to use when generating a makefile. The value of this variable is typically handled internally by <em>qmake</em> and rarely needs to be modified.</p>
<a name="OBJECTS"></a><h5><a name="4-2-8"></a>OBJECTS</h5>
<p>This variable is generated from the <a href="qmake-manual-8.html#SOURCES">SOURCES</a> variable. The extension of each source file will have been replaced by .o (Unix) or .obj (Win32). The value of this variable is typically handled by <em>qmake</em> or <a href="qmake-manual-8.html#QMAKESPEC">qmake.conf</a> and rarely needs to be modified.</p>
<a name="OBJMOC"></a><h5><a name="4-2-9"></a>OBJMOC</h5>
<p>This variable is set by <em>qmake</em> if files can be found that contain the Q_OBJECT macro. <tt>OBJMOC</tt> contains the name of all intermediate moc object files. The value of this variable is typically handled by <em>qmake</em> or <a href="qmake-manual-8.html#QMAKESPEC">qmake.conf</a> and rarely needs to be modified.</p>
<a name="PRECOMPILED_HEADER"></a><h5><a name="4-2-10"></a>PRECOMPILED_HEADER</h5>
<p>This variable indicates the header file for creating a precompiled header file, to increase the compilation speed of a project. Precompiled headers are currently only supported on some platforms (Windows - all MSVC project types, Mac OS X - Xcode, Makefile, UNIX - gcc 3.3 and up).</p>
<p>On other platforms, this variable has different meaning, as noted below.</p>
<p>This variable contains a list of header files that require some sort of pre-compilation step (such as with moc). The value of this variable is typically handled by <em>qmake</em> or <a href="qmake-manual-8.html#QMAKESPEC">qmake.conf</a> and rarely needs to be modified.</p>
<a name="QMAKE"></a><h5><a name="4-2-11"></a>QMAKE</h5>
<p>This variable contains the name of the <em>qmake</em> program itself and is placed in generated makefiles. The value of this variable is typically handled by <em>qmake</em> or <a href="qmake-manual-8.html#QMAKESPEC">qmake.conf</a> and rarely needs to be modified.</p>
<a name="QMAKESPEC_systemvariable"></a><h5><a name="4-2-12"></a>QMAKESPEC</h5>
<p>This variable contains the name of the <em>qmake</em> configuration to use when generating makefiles. The value of this variable is typically handled by <em>qmake</em> and rarely needs to be modified. Use the <a href="qmake-manual-8.html#QMAKESPEC">QMAKESPEC</a> environment variable instead.</p>
<a name="QMAKE_APP_FLAG"></a><h5><a name="4-2-13"></a>QMAKE_APP_FLAG</h5>
<p>This variable is empty unless the 'app' <a href="qmake-manual-8.html#TEMPLATE">TEMPLATE</a> is specified. The value of this variable is typically handled by <em>qmake</em> or <a href="qmake-manual-8.html#QMAKESPEC">qmake.conf</a> and rarely needs to be modified. Use the following instead:</p>
<pre>
app {
        #conditional code for 'app' template here
}
</pre>
<a name="QMAKE_APP_OR_DLL"></a><h5><a name="4-2-14"></a>QMAKE_APP_OR_DLL</h5>
<p>This variable is empty unless the 'app' or 'dll' <a href="qmake-manual-8.html#TEMPLATE">TEMPLATE</a> is specified. The value of this variable is typically handled by <em>qmake</em> or <a href="qmake-manual-8.html#QMAKESPEC">qmake.conf</a> and rarely needs to be modified.</p>

<a name="Functions"></a><h3><a name="5"></a>Functions</h3>
<p><em>qmake</em> recognizes the following functions:</p>
<h4><a name="5-1"></a>include( filename )</h4>
<p>This function will include the contents of <em>filename</em> into the current project at the point where was included. The function succeeds if <em>filename</em> was included, otherwise it fails. You can check the return value of this function using a scope.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre>
include( shared.pri )
OPTIONS = standard custom
!include( options.pri ) {
        message( "No custom build options specified" )
        OPTIONS -= custom
}
</pre>
<h4><a name="5-2"></a>exists( file )</h4>
<p>This function will test if <em>file</em> exists. If the file exists, then it will succeed; otherwise it will fail. You can specify a regular expression in file and it will succeed if any file matches the regular expression specified.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre>
exists( $(QTDIR)/lib/libqt-mt* ) {
      message( "Configuring for multi-threaded Qt..." )
      CONFIG += thread
}
</pre>
<h4><a name="5-3"></a>contains( variablename, value )</h4>
<p>This function will succeed if the variable <em>variablename</em> contains the value <em>value</em>. You can check the return value of this function using a scope.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre>
contains( drivers, network ) {
        # drivers contains 'network'
        message( "Configuring for network build..." )
        HEADERS += network.h
        SOURCES += network.cpp
}
</pre>
<h4><a name="5-4"></a>count( variablename, number )</h4>
<p>This function will succeed if the variable <em>variablename</em> contains <em>number</em> elements, otherwise it will fail. You can check the return value of this function using a scope.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre>
MYVAR = one two three
count( MYVAR, 3 ) {
        # always true
}
</pre>
<h4><a name="5-5"></a>infile( filename, var, val )</h4>
<p>This function will succeed if the file <em>filename</em> (when parsed by qmake itself) contains the variable <em>var</em> with a value of <em>val</em>. You may also not pass in a third argument (<em>val</em>) and the function will only test if <em>var</em> has been assigned to in the file.</p>
<h4><a name="5-6"></a>isEmpty( variablename )</h4>
<p>This function will succeed if the variable <em>variablename</em> is empty (same as <tt>count(variable, 0)</tt>).</p>
<h4><a name="5-7"></a>system( command )</h4>
<p>This function will execute <tt>command</tt> in a secondary shell and will succeed if the command exits with an exit status of 1. You can check the return value of this function using a scope.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre>
  system(ls /bin):HAS_BIN=FALSE
</pre>
<h4><a name="5-8"></a>message( string )</h4>
<p>This function will always succeed, and will display the given <em>string</em> to the user.</p>
<h4><a name="5-9"></a>error( string )</h4>
<p>This function will never return a value. It will display the given <em>string</em> to the user, and then exit <em>qmake</em>. This function should only be used for very fatal configurations.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre>
  release:debug:error(You can't have release and debug at the same time!)
</pre>
<a name="Properties"></a><h3><a name="6"></a>Properties</h3>
<p><em>qmake</em> has a system of persistant information, this allows you to 'set' a variable in qmake once, and each time qmake is invoked this value can be queried. Use the following to set a property in qmake:</p>
<pre>
qmake -set VARIABLE VALUE
</pre>
<p>To retrieve this information back from qmake you can do:</p>
<pre>
qmake -query VARIABLE
qmake -query #queries all current VARIABLE/VALUE pairs..
</pre>
<p>This information will be saved into a QSettings object (meaning it will be stored in different places for different platforms). As VARIABLE is versioned as well, you can set one value in an older version of qmake, and newer versions will retrieve this value, however if you -set VARIABLE into a newer version of qmake the older version will not use this value. You can however query a specific version of a variable if you prefix that version of qmake to VARIABLE, as in:</p>
<pre>
qmake -query "1.06a/VARIABLE"
</pre>
<p>qmake also has the notion of 'builtin' properties, for example you can query the installation of Qt for this version of qmake with the QT_INSTALL_PREFIX property:</p>
<pre>
qmake -query "QT_INSTALL_PREFIX"
</pre>
<p>These builtin properties cannot have a version prefixed to them as they are not versioned and each qmake will have its own notion of these values. The list below outlines the builtin properties:</p>
<ul><li><p>QT_INSTALL_PREFIX - Where the version of Qt this qmake is built for resides</p>
<li><p>QT_INSTALL_DATA - Where data for this version of Qt resides</p>
<li><p>QMAKE_VERSION - The current version of qmake</p>
</ul><p>Finally, these values can be queried in a project file with a special notation such as:</p>
<pre>
QMAKE_VERS = $$[QMAKE_VERSION]
</pre>
<a name="Environment"></a><h3><a name="7"></a>Environment Variables and Configuration</h3>
<a name="QMAKESPEC"></a><h4><a name="7-1"></a>QMAKESPEC</h4>
<p><em>qmake</em> requires a platform and compiler description file which contains many default values used to generate appropriate makefiles. The standard Qt distribution comes with many of these files, located in the 'mkspecs' subdirectory of the Qt installation.</p>
<p>The QMAKESPEC environment variable can contain any of the following:</p>
<ul><li><p>A complete path to a directory containing a qmake.conf file. In this case <em>qmake</em> will open the qmake.conf file from within that directory. If the file does not exist, <em>qmake</em> will exit with an error.</p>
<li><p>The name of a platform-compiler combination. In this case, <em>qmake</em> will search in the directory specified by the QTDIR environment variable.</p>
</ul><p>Note: the QMAKESPEC path will automatically be added to the <a href="qmake-manual-8.html#INCLUDEPATH">INCLUDEPATH</a> system variable.</p>
<a name="INSTALLS"></a><h4><a name="7-2"></a>INSTALLS</h4>
<p>It is common on UNIX to be able to install from the same utility as you build with (e.g make install). For this <em>qmake</em> has introduce the concept of an install set. The notation for this is quite simple, first you fill in an "object" in qmake for example:</p>
<pre>
  documentation.path = /usr/local/program/doc
  documentation.files = docs/*
</pre>
<p>In this way you are telling <em>qmake</em> several things about this install, first that you plan to install to /usr/local/program/doc (the path member), second that you plan to copy everything in the docs directory. Once this is done you may insert it in the install list:</p>
<pre>
  INSTALLS += documentation
</pre>
<p>Now <em>qmake</em> will take over making sure the correct things are copied to the specified places. If however you require greater control you may use the 'extra' member of the object:</p>
<pre>
  unix:documentation.extra = create_docs; mv master.doc toc.doc
</pre>
<p>Then qmake will run the things in extra (this is of course platform specific, so you may need to test for your platform first, this case we test for unix). Then it will do the normal processings of the files member. Finally if you appened a builtin install to INSTALLS <em>qmake</em> (and do not specify a files or extra member) will decide what needs to be copied for you, currently the only supported builtin is target:</p>
<pre>
  target.path = /usr/local/myprogram
  INSTALLS += target
</pre>
<p>With this <em>qmake</em> will know what you plan need copied, and do this for you.</p>
<a name="cache"></a><h4><a name="7-3"></a>Cache File</h4>
<p>The cache file (mentioned above in the options) is a special file <em>qmake</em> will read to find settings not specified in the <tt>qmake.conf</tt> file, the .pro file, or the command line. If <tt>-nocache</tt> is not specified, <em>qmake</em> will try to find a file called <tt>.qmake.cache</tt> in parent directories. If it fails to find this file, it will silently ignore this step of processing.</p>
<a name="LibDepend"></a><h4><a name="7-4"></a>Library Dependencies</h4>
<p>Often when linking against a library <em>qmake</em> relies on the underlying platform to know what other libraries this library links against, and lets the platform pull them in. In many cases, however, this is not sufficent. For example when statically linking a library there are no libraries linked against, and therefore no dependencies to those libraries are created - however an application that later links against this library will need to know where to find the symbols that the linked in library will require. To help with this situation <em>qmake</em> will follow a library's dependencies when it feels appropriate, however this behaviour must be enabled in <em>qmake</em>. To enable requires two steps. First, you must enable it in the library - to do this you must tell <em>qmake</em> to save information about this library:</p>
<pre>
  CONFIG += create_prl
</pre>
<p>This is only relevant to the lib template, and will be ignored for all others. When this option is enabled <em>qmake</em> will create a file (called a .prl file) which will save some meta information about the library. This metafile is itself just a qmake project file, but with all internal variables. You are free to view this file, and if deleted <em>qmake</em> will know to recreate it when necesary (either when the .pro file is later read, or if a dependent library (described below) has changed). When installing this library (by using target in INSTALLS, above) <em>qmake</em> will automatically copy the .prl file to your install path.</p>
<p>The second step to enabling this processing is to turn on reading of the meta information created above:</p>
<pre>
  CONFIG += link_prl
</pre>
<p>When this is turned on <em>qmake</em> will process all libraries linked to, and find their meta information. With this meta information <em>qmake</em> will figure out what is relevant to linking, specifically it will add to your list of DEFINES as well as LIBS. Once <em>qmake</em> has processed this file, it will then look through the newly introduced LIBS and find their dependent .prl files, and continue until all libraries have been resolved. At this point the makefile is created as usual, and the libraries are linked explicity against your program.</p>
<p>The internals of the .prl file are left closed so they can easily change later. It is not designed to be changed by hand however, and should only be created by <em>qmake</em> - these .prl files should also not be transfered from operating system to operating system as they may be platform dependent (like a makefile).</p>
<a name="Extensions"></a><h4><a name="7-5"></a>File Extensions</h4>
<p>Under normal circumstances <em>qmake</em> will try to use appropriate file extensions for your platform. There may be times, however, that you would like to override the behavior of these extensions. To do this, you must modify builtin variables in your .pro file, which will in turn changes <em>qmake</em>'s interpretation of these files. You may do this as:</p>
<pre>
  QMAKE_EXT_MOC = .mymoc
</pre>
<p>The variables are as follows:</p>
<ul><li><p>QMAKE_EXT_MOC - This modifies the extension placed on included moc files.</p>
<li><p>QMAKE_EXT_UI - This modifies the extension used for designer UI files (usually in FORMS).</p>
<li><p>QMAKE_EXT_PRL - This modifies the extension placed on <a href="qmake-manual-8.html#LibDepend">library dependency files</a>.</p>
<li><p>QMAKE_EXT_LEX - This changes the suffix used in files (usually in LEXSOURCES).</p>
<li><p>QMAKE_EXT_YACC - This changes the suffix used in files (usually in YACCSOURCES).</p>
<li><p>QMAKE_EXT_OBJ - This changes the suffix used on generated object files.</p>
</ul><p>All the above accept just the first value, so you must assign to it one value that will be used through your makefile. There are two variables that accept a list of values, they are:</p>
<ul><li><p>QMAKE_EXT_CPP - Changes interpretation all files with these suffixes to be C++ source files.</p>
<li><p>QMAKE_EXT_H - Changes interpretation all files with these suffixes to be C header files.</p>
</ul><a name="Customizing"></a><h4><a name="7-6"></a>Customizing Makefile Output</h4>
<p>qmake often tries to be all things to all build tools, this is often less than ideal when you really need to run special platform dependent commands. This can be achieved with specific instructions to the different qmake backends (currently this is only supported by the UNIX <a href="qmake-manual-8.html#MAKEFILE_GENERATOR">generator</a>).</p>
<p>The interfaces to customizing the Makefile are done through "objects" as in other places in qmake. The notation for this is quite simple, first you fill in an "object" in qmake for example:</p>
<pre>
  mytarget.target = .buildfile
  mytarget.commands = touch $$mytarget.target
  mytarget.depends = mytarget2

  mytarget2.commands = @echo Building $$mytarget.target
</pre>
<p>The information above defines a qmake target called mytarget which contains a Makefile target called .buildfile, .buildfile is generated by 'touch .buildfile', and finally that this Makefile target depends on the qmake target mytarget2. Additionally we've defined the qmake target mytarget2 which simply echo's something to stdout.</p>
<p>The final step to making use of the above is to instruct qmake that this is actually an object used by the target building parts of qmake by:</p>
<pre>
QMAKE_EXTRA_UNIX_TARGETS += mytarget mytarget2
</pre>
<p>This is all you need to do to actually build custom targets in qmake, of course you may want to tie one of these targets to actually building the <a href="qmake-manual-8.html#TARGET">qmake build target</a>. To do this, you simply need to include your Makefile target in the list of <a href="qmake-manual-8.html#PRE_TARGETDEPS">PRE_TARGETDEPS</a>.</p>
<p>For convenience there is also a method of customizing (UNIX) projects for generic new compilers (or even preprocessors).</p>
<pre>
new_moc.output  = moc_${QMAKE_FILE_BASE}.cpp
new_moc.commands = moc ${QMAKE_FILE_NAME} -o ${QMAKE_FILE_OUT}
new_moc.depends = g++ -E -M ${QMAKE_FILE_NAME} | sed "s,^.*: ,,"
new_moc.input = NEW_HEADERS
QMAKE_EXTRA_UNIX_COMPILERS += new_moc
</pre>
<p>With this you can create a new moc for qmake, the commands will be executed over all arguments given to a NEW_HEADERS variable (from the input variable), and write to output (and automatically hand this filename to the compiler to be linked into your target). Additionally qmake will execute depends to generate dependency information and place this in the project as well.</p>
<p>These commands can easily be placed into a cache file, and subsequent .pro files can give several arguments to NEW_HEADERS.</p>
