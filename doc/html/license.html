trademark notices and disclaimers, as released by the initial developer
of the Software, is distributed.
<p> 3. You may make modifications to the Software and distribute your

notices in the distribution explaining this.
<p> c. You must ensure that all modifications included in the
machine-executable forms are available under the terms of this

these items are also able to receive and use the complete
machine-readable source code to the items without any charge

<p> b. You must explicitly license all recipients of your items to use
and re-distribute original and modified versions of the items in
both machine-executable and source code forms. The recipients must
be able to do so without any charges whatsoever, and they must be
able to re-distribute to anyone they choose.
<p> c. If the items are not available to the general public, and the
initial developer of the Software requests a copy of the items,
then you must supply one.
