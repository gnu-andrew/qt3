\title Pictures of Most Qt Widgets

Most of these widgets are shown in either Motif or Windows style. 
All widgets are supported in both styles (and other \link QStyle
styles\endlink), but for clarity we just present a selection.

Qt provides more widgets than the selection shown below. And extra Qt
are available from third parties, and as add-ons to Qt; see \link
http://www.trolltech.com/products/solutions/index.html Qt
Solutions\endlink, and \link
http://www.trolltech.com/freesoftware/index.html User contributed Qt
additions\endlink.

Below is a screen shot of the demo example running under Linux. It
shows off many of Qt's widgets. (The source is in \c{examples/demo}.

Below we have three views seperated by \l {QSplitter}s. At the
top-left there's a \l QListBox, at the top-right there's a \l
QListView with a \l QHeader and two \l {QScrollBar}s. And at the
bottom there's a \l QIconView.

\img splitter-views-w.png

Below we present a \l QMainWindow which has
a \l QMenuBar and some \l {QToolBar}s that contain
various widgets, e.g. \l {QToolButton}s and \l {QComboBox}es. The central
widget is a \l QWorkspace which is used for MDI window management and
which contains an MDI-Window featuring a \l QTextEdit. At the bottom
you see a \l QStatusBar and at the bottom-right a \l QSizeGrip.

The image below shows a \l QFileDialog. On the Macintosh and Windows
platforms you can either use a QFileDialog or the native file
dialog. This is explained in the \l QFileDialog class documentation.

\img qfiledlg-w.png

Below is a QPrintDialog. On Macintosh and Windows the native print
dialog is used, but for other platforms we provide QPrintDialog. Use
QPrinter::setup() for portability instead of the QPrintDialog if you
need to be platform independent.

\img qprintdlg-m.png

Below is a \l QFontDialog.

\caption Windows

The screenshot below shows a \l QColorDialog.

\img qcolordlg-w.png

Messages are presented using \l{QMessageBox}es, as shown below.

\img qmsgbox-w.png

The image below shows a \l QProgressDialog. The \l QProgressBar can
also be used as a separate widget.

\img qprogdlg-w.png

In the screenshot below we have a \l QGroupBox that contains a \l
QLineEdit, a read-only \l QComboBox and an editable \l QComboBox.

\img groupbox-w.png

The screenshot below shows a \l QPopupMenu.

\img qpopmenu-w.png

In the screenshot below there's a \l QButtonGroup containing four \l
{QRadioButton}s and two \l {QCheckBox}es.

THIS IMAGE DOESN'T SHOW ANYTHING UNDERSTANDABLY USEFUL

All views in the first screenshot are widgets derived from a \l
QScrollView. But this class can also manage lots of child-widgets,
like in this screenshot.

The screenshot below shows a \l QTabDialog. The tabs (\l QTabBar) or the
more convenient class \l QTabWidget, which combines a tab bar with
the pages, can be used separately. In the visible page you see a \l
QLabel, the range controls \l QSlider and \l QSpinBox and below a \l
QLCDNumber. In the bottom row there are some \l {QPushButton}s.

\img qtabdlg-w.png

In the screenshot below there's a \l QTextBrowser displaying a HTML
page. See also \l QTextEdit.
