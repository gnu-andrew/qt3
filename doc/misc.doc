\title Brief Technical FAQ


This document describes how to use more than one Qt version on one
machine and how to use Qt on X11 without a window manager. In addition
it explains the most common source of link errors with Qt.

Other frequently asked questions can be found in the

\target linkerror
\section1 Link error, complaining about a lack of \c vtbl, \c _vtbl, \c __vtbl or similar

This indicates that you've included the Q_OBJECT macro in a class
declaration and probably also run the moc, but forgot to link the
moc-generated object code into your executable. See \link moc.html
Using the Meta Object Compiler\endlink for details on how to use moc.

\target diffver
\section1 Using different versions of Qt on the same machine

Qt programs need the following components of a Qt distribution:

<dl>

<dt>Header files - Compile time

<dd>Programmers need to include the Qt header files.  The Qt header files
are usually located in the \c include subdirectory of Qt distributions.
Care must be taken to include the header files of the relevant release of
Qt. Those with a command-line compiler will typically use options such as
\c{/I%QTDIR%\include} or \c{-I"$QTDIR"/include} provided \c QTDIR specifies
the relevant release of Qt.

<dt>Meta Object Compiler and other tools - Compile time

<dd>Programmers need to run \e moc and other tools such as \e uic. These
tools are usually located in the \c bin subdirectory of Qt distributions.
Either run \c "$QTDIR"/bin/moc and \c "$QTDIR"/bin/uic or add \c "$QTDIR"/bin
to your \c PATH and run \c moc and \c uic. If you use \c qmake the
appropriate lines will be added to your Makefiles so that \e uic and
\e moc will be executed as required.

<dt>Static or shared libraries - Link time

<dd>Programmers need to link with the Qt static or shared libraries. The Qt
libraries are usually located in the \c lib subdirectory of Qt distributions.
Care must be taken to link with the libraries of the relevant release of
Qt.  Those with a command-line compiler will typically use options such as
\c{/L%QTDIR%\lib\qt.lib} or \c{-L"$QTDIR"/lib} \c -lqt provided \c QTDIR
specifies the relevant release of Qt.

<dt>Shared libraries - Run time

<dd>Users of programs linked with shared Qt libraries need these same
shared libraries to run these programs.  The Qt libraries are usually
located in the \c lib subdirectory of Qt distributions.  Shared libraries
are made available to programs in places such as \c{C:\windows\system} on
Windows platforms, directories listed in file \c /etc/ld.so.conf on Linux,
standard \c lib directories on Unix, or directories listed in environment
variables \c LD_LIBRARY_PATH, \c SHLIB_PATH, or \c LIBPATH on various Unix
flavours.  Make the relevant Qt libraries available using one of these
mechanisms.

</dl>

Qt distributions consist of different files needed at compile time,
link time, or run time. Trolltech distributes Qt in the form of a
source package that contain all these files once they have been built.

Other vendors distribute Qt in the form of binary packages. Binary packages
usually consist of two parts:

\list
\i shared libraries in the run time package, usually called \c qt3.

\i header files, static libraries, the moc and other tools in the developers'
kit, usually called \c qt3-dev.

\endlist

Depending on how you are using Qt, you need to make specific parts of
the Qt distribution available to your programs.  Typical situations are
described below.

\target qtbin
\section2 Developers building for a single version of Qt on Unix - Qt binary packages

You build programs with a single version of Qt, but you still need
to run programs linked with another version of Qt.  You are typically
a Linux developer who builds programs for Qt 3.x on a KDE desktop based
on Qt 2.x.  Qt packages are usually split into a shared library
package with a name like \c qt and a developer package with a name
like \c qt-dev.  You will need the appropriate packages:

\list

\i To build programs you will need the header files, the libraries,
the moc and other tools from Qt 3.x. They are included in the developer
package of Qt 3.x (\c qt3-dev or similar).

\i To run programs you will need the shared libraries of Qt 3.x and
Qt 2.x.  They are included in the regular packages of Qt 3.x (\c qt3
or similar) and Qt 2.x (\c qt2 or similar).

\endlist

Just install the packages, \c qt2, \c qt3, and \c qt3-dev. You may
need to set the environment variable \c QTDIR to point to Qt 3.x.

\target qtsrc
\section2 Developers building for two versions of Qt on Unix - Qt sources

You build and run programs for Qt 2.x and Qt 3.x. You will need:

\list

\i the header files, the libraries, the moc and other tools from Qt 3.x
and Qt 2.x to build programs,

\i the shared libraries of Qt 3.x and Qt 2.x to run programs.

\endlist

Get the source distributions of both Qt 2.x and Qt 3.x.

\list 1

\i Install and build Qt 2.x and Qt 3.x, usually in \c /opt or
\c /usr/local. In the case of \c /opt:

\code
$ cd /opt
$ gunzip -c \c qt-x11-2.3.1.tar.gz | tar xf -
$ cd qt-2.3.1
$ setenv QTDIR /opt/qt-2.3.1
$ configure [options]
$ make

$ cd /opt
$ gunzip -c qt-x11-free-3.0.0.tar.gz | tar xf -
$ cd qt-3.0.0
$ setenv QTDIR /opt/qt-3.0.0
$ configure [options]
$ make
\endcode

\i Make shared libraries available to programs at run time. Either
add both \c /opt/qt-2.3.1/lib and \c /opt/qt-3.0.0/lib to your environment
variable \c LD_LIBRARY_PATH or file \c /etc/ld.so.conf or whataver mechanism
you're using, or make links to the libraries in a standard directory like
\c /usr/local/lib:

\code
cd /usr/local/lib
ln -s /opt/qt-2.3.1/lib/libqt.so.2 .
ln -s /opt/qt-2.3.1/lib/libqt-mt.so.2 .
ln -s /opt/qt-2.3.1/lib/libqutil.so.1 .
ln -s /opt/qt-3.0.0/lib/libqt.so.3 .
ln -s /opt/qt-3.0.0/lib/libqui.so.1 .
\endcode

\endlist

To develop with Qt 2.x use:

\code
setenv QTDIR /opt/qt-2.3.1
setenv PATH ${QTDIR}/bin:${PATH}
\endcode

To develop with Qt 3.x use:

\code
setenv QTDIR /opt/qt-3.0.0
setenv PATH ${QTDIR}/bin:${PATH}
\endcode

Setting \c QTDIR ensures that the proper resources are used, such as the
documentation appropriate to the version of Qt you're using.  Also
your Makfiles may refer to \c "$QTDIR"/include and \c "$QTDIR"/lib to
include the proper header files and link with the proper libraries.
Setting the \c PATH ensures that the proper version of moc and other
tools is being used.

\target nowinman
\section1 Using Qt on X11 without a window manager

When using Qt without a window manager on Unix/X11, you will most
likely experience focus problems. Without a window manager, there is
no focus handling on X11, and no concept of an active window
either. If you want your application to work in such an environment,
you have to explicitly mark a window as active \e after showing it:

\code
 yourWindow->show();
 yourWindow->setActiveWindow();
\endcode

Note that setActiveWindow() won't work if the widget does not become
physically visible during this event cycle. However, without a window
manager running, this is guaranteed to happen. For the curious reader:
setActiveWindow() emulates a window manager by explicitly setting the
X Input Focus to a widget's top level window.

\title How to Report A Bug

If you think you have found a bug in Qt, we would like to hear
about it so that we can fix it.

Before reporting a bug, please check the
\link commonproblems.html Brief Technical FAQ\endlink, the
\link http://www.trolltech.com/developer/faqs/ FAQs\endlink, and the
\link http://www.trolltech.com/platforms/ Platform Notes\endlink
on our web site to see if the issue is already known.

Always include the following information in your bug report:

\list 1
\i The name and version number of your compiler
\i The name and version number of your operating system
\i The version of Qt you are using, and what configure options it was
compiled with.
\endlist

If the problem you are reporting is only at visible run-time, try to
create a small test program that shows the problem when run.  Often,
such a program can be created with some minor changes to one
of the many example programs in the \c{qt/examples} directory.

Please send the bug report to
\link mailto:qt-bugs@trolltech.com qt-bugs@trolltech.com\endlink.

 You may use, distribute and copy the Qt GUI Toolkit under the terms of
 GNU General Public License version 2, which is displayed below.

		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
		       Version 2, June 1991

 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
                       51 Franklin Steet, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301, USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

			    Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this License.

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form with such
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and

	Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) 19yy  <name of author>

    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Steet, Fifth Floor,
    Boston, MA 02110-1301, USA.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:

    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19yy name of author
    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989
  Ty Coon, President of Vice

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General
Public License instead of this License.

\title Books about GUI

This is not a comprehensive list of books, there are many other
books worth buying. Here we mention just a few GUI/UI books that don't
gather dust in our shelves.

<b>C++ GUI Programming with Qt 3</b> by Jasmin Blanchette and Mark
Summerfield, ISBN 0-13-124072-2. This is the Official Qt book written
by two veteran Trolls.
\link http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0131240722/trolltech/
(Read more about it or buy it.)\endlink

<b>The Design of Everyday Things</b> by Donald Norman,
ISBN 0-38526774-6, is one of the classics of human interface design.
Norman shows how badly something as simple as a kitchen stove can be
designed, and everyone should read it who will design a dialog box,
write an error message, or design just about anything else humans are
supposed to use.
\link http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0385267746/trolltech/t 
(Read more or buy it.)\endlink

\target fowler
<b>GUI Design Handbook</b> by Susan Fowler, ISBN 0-07-059274-8, is an
alphabetical dictionary of widgets and other user interface elements,
with comprehensive coverage of each.  Each chapter covers one widget
or other element, contains the most important recommendation from the
Macintosh, Windows and Motif style guides, notes about common
problems, comparison with other widgets that can serve some of the
same roles as this one, etc.

(Read more or buy it.)\endlink

<b>Macintosh Human Interface Guidelines</b>, second edition, ISBN
0-201-62216-5, is worth buying for the \e {don't}s alone.  Even
though you're not writing Macintosh software, avoiding most of what it
advises against will produce more easily comprehensible software.
Doing what it tells you to \e do helps, too.

OS 8 addendum.\endlink

<b>The Microsoft Windows User Experience</b>, ISBN 1-55615-679-0,
is Microsoft's look and feel Bible.  Indispensable for everyone who
has customers that worship Microsoft, and it's quite good, too.

Microsoft's guidelines are often available on the web, but have
occasionally been hidden in an impenetrable maze of javascript.
\link http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/dnwue/html/welcome.asp Try and see.\endlink

<b>The Icon Book</b> by William Horton, ISBN 0-471-59900-X, is a
perhaps the only thorough coverage of icons and icon use in software.
In order for icons to be successful, people must be able to do four
things with them: decode, recognize, find and activate them.  This
book explains these goals from scratch and how to reach them, both
with single icons and icon families.  Some 500 examples are scattered
throughout the text, generally in groups of four or five.

\title Window Geometry

\section1 Overview

QWidget provides several functions that deal with a widget's
geometry.  Some of these functions operate on the pure client area
(i.e. the window excluding the window frame), others include the
window frame. The differentiation is done in a way that covers the
most common usage transparently.

\table
\row
\i <strong>Including the window frame:
\i x(), y(), frameGeometry(), pos() and move()
\row
\i <strong>Excluding the window frame:</strong>
\i geometry(), width(), height(), rect() and size()
\endtable

Note that the distinction only matters for decorated top-level
widgets. For all child widgets, the frame geometry is equal to the
widget's client geometry.

This diagram shows most of the functions in use:
\img geometry.png Geometry diagram

\section1 Unix/X11 peculiarities

On Unix/X11, a window does not have a frame until the window manager
decorates it. This happens asynchronously at some point in time after
calling show() and the first paint event the window receives: or it
does not happen at all. Bear in mind that X11 is policy-free (others
call it flexible). Thus you cannot make any safe assumption about the
decoration frame your window will get. Basic rule: there's always one
user who uses a window manager that breaks your assumption, and who
will complain to you.

Furthermore, a toolkit cannot simply place windows on the screen. All
Qt can do is to send certain hints to the window manager. The window
manager, a separate process, may either obey, ignore or misunderstand
them. Due to the partially unclear Inter-Client Communication
Conventions Manual (ICCCM), window placement is handled quite
differently in existing window managers.

X11 provides no standard or easy way to get the frame geometry once
the window is decorated. Qt solves this problem with nifty heuristics
and clever code that works on a wide range of window managers that
exist today. Don't be surprised if you find one where frameGeometry()
returns bogus results though.

Nor does X11 provide a way to maximize a window. The showMaximized()
function in Qt therefore has to emulate the feature. Its result
depends on the result of frameGeometry() and the capability of the
window manager to do proper window placement, neither of which can be
guaranteed.

\section1 Restoring a Window's Geometry

A common task in modern applications is to restore a window's geometry
in a later session. On Windows, this is basically storing the result
of geometry() and calling setGeometry() in the next session before
calling show(). On X11, this won't work because an invisible window
doesn't have a frame yet. The window manager would decorate the window
later. When this happens, the window shifts towards the bottom/right
corner of the screen depending on the size of the decoration frame. X
theoretically provides a way to avoid this shift. Our tests have
shown, though, that almost all window managers fail to implement this
feature.

A workaround is to call setGeometry() after show(). This has the
two disadvantages that the widget appears at a wrong place for a
millisecond (results in flashing) and that currently only every
second window manager gets it right. A safer solution is to store
both pos() and size() and to restore the geometry using resize() and
move() before calling show(), as demonstrated in the following
example:

\code
    MyWidget* widget = new MyWidget
    ...
    QPoint p = widget->pos();	// store position
    QSize s = widget->size();	// store size
    ...
    widget = new MyWidget;
    widget->resize( s ); 	// restore size
    widget->move( p ); 		// restore position
    widget->show();		// show widget
\endcode

This method works on both MS-Windows and most existing X11 window
managers.
